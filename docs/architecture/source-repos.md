# Source Repositories & Acknowledgments

**TFGrid Compose was built by extracting and unifying proven, production-ready implementations.**

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

TFGrid Compose is **not built from scratch**. Instead, it:

1. **Extracts** working code from proven repositories
2. **Unifies** them under a common deployer framework  
3. **Simplifies** the deployment experience
4. **Standardizes** the workflow

This approach provides:
- ✅ **Battle-tested code** - Already working in production
- ✅ **Faster development** - No reinventing the wheel
- ✅ **Lower risk** - Proven architectures
- ✅ **Quality assurance** - Real-world validation

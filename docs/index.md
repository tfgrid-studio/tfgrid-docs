## 🎯 What is TFGrid Studio?

**TFGrid Studio** is a complete development platform for ThreeFold Grid. The flagship tool, **tfgrid-compose**, brings docker-compose-style simplicity to decentralized deployments.

```bash
# Deploy any application with one command
tfgrid-compose up my-app
```

**No vendor lock-in. Industry standards. Decentralized infrastructure.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install tfgrid-compose

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/tfgrid-studio/tfgrid-compose
cd tfgrid-compose
make install

# Verify installation
tfgrid-compose --version
```

### 2. Configure ThreeFold

```bash
# Store your mnemonic
mkdir -p ~/.config/threefold
echo "your mnemonic words" > ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
chmod 600 ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
```

### 3. Create Context File (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# In your project directory
echo "app: ../tfgrid-ai-agent" > .tfgrid-compose.yaml
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# With context file
tfgrid-compose up

# Or specify app path
tfgrid-compose up ../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

**That's it!** Your application is now running on ThreeFold Grid. 🎉

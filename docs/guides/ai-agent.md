## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the AI Agent

```bash
# Deploy to ThreeFold Grid
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

**What happens:**

1. ‚úÖ Creates Ubuntu 24.04 VM (4 CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB disk)
2. ‚úÖ Configures WireGuard networking  
3. ‚úÖ Installs Node.js 20.x, Qwen CLI
4. ‚úÖ Prompts for git credentials (one time)
5. ‚úÖ Sets up workspace at `/home/developer/code`
6. ‚úÖ Runs health checks

**Duration:** ~2-3 minutes

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ üéâ Deployment complete!
‚Ñπ App: tfgrid-ai-agent v0.9.0
‚Ñπ Pattern: single-vm v0.9.0

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Simple Web App

```bash
# 1. Deploy
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent

# 2. Configure git (first time only)
tfgrid-compose login

# 3. Create project (interactive)
tfgrid-compose create simple-blog
# Prompts for:
# - Duration: 1h
# - Prompt: "Create a simple blog with React and Node.js"
# - Start now: y

# 4. Monitor progress
tfgrid-compose monitor simple-blog

# 5. Check all projects
tfgrid-compose projects

# 6. View results
tfgrid-compose summary simple-blog
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/simple-blog
ls -la
cat README.md

# 7. Stop project
tfgrid-compose stop simple-blog

# 8. Cleanup (if done)
tfgrid-compose down
```

### Workflow 2: Code Refactoring

```bash
# 1. Create refactoring project
tfgrid-compose create refactor-legacy
# Prompt: "Refactor this legacy code to TypeScript with best practices"

# 2. Upload existing code
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/refactor-legacy
# Copy your files here
git add .
git commit -m "Initial code to refactor"
exit

# 3. Run agent
tfgrid-compose run refactor-legacy

# 4. Watch it work
tfgrid-compose monitor refactor-legacy

# 5. Check progress
tfgrid-compose summary refactor-legacy

# 6. Review and iterate
tfgrid-compose logs refactor-legacy
tfgrid-compose edit refactor-legacy  # Adjust if needed
tfgrid-compose restart refactor-legacy
```

### Workflow 3: Multiple Projects

```bash
# Create several projects
tfgrid-compose create frontend-app
tfgrid-compose create backend-api
tfgrid-compose create mobile-app

# Run them all
tfgrid-compose run frontend-app
tfgrid-compose run backend-api
tfgrid-compose run mobile-app

# Check status of all
tfgrid-compose projects

# Monitor specific one
tfgrid-compose monitor frontend-app

# Stop all when done
tfgrid-compose stopall
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Prompts

**Good:**
```
"Create a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL for a todo app with authentication"
"Refactor this code to use async/await and add error handling"
"Generate API documentation with examples for all endpoints"
```

**Bad:**
```
"Make it better" (too vague)
"Build everything" (too broad)
"Fix bugs" (which bugs?)
```

### 2. Time Constraints

```bash
# Short tasks
tfgrid-compose create quick-fix
# Duration: 30m

# Medium projects
tfgrid-compose create web-dashboard  
# Duration: 2h

# Long-running projects
tfgrid-compose create full-refactor
# Duration: indefinite
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

```bash
# Always monitor long-running tasks
tfgrid-compose run big-project &
tfgrid-compose monitor big-project

# Check all projects regularly
tfgrid-compose projects
```

### 4. Resource Management

```bash
# Stop when not needed
tfgrid-compose stopall

# Remove completed projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project

# Destroy VM when done
tfgrid-compose down
```

##Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these on your local machine before deployment:

```bash
# Required
export TF_VAR_mnemonic=$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)

# Optional
export QWEN_API_KEY='your-api-key'        # Qwen API key
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your-token'           # GitHub personal token
export GITEA_URL='https://gitea.example'   # Gitea URL
export GITEA_TOKEN='your-token'            # Gitea personal token
```

### Custom Resources

Edit `tfgrid-ai-agent/tfgrid-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  cpu:
    minimum: 2
    recommended: 4     # Change this
  memory:
    minimum: 4096
    recommended: 8192  # Change this
  disk:
    minimum: 50
    recommended: 100   # Change this
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
tfgrid-compose down && tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

---

## Monitoring & Logs

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Watch agent progress
tfgrid-compose monitor my-project

# View live logs
tfgrid-compose logs my-project

# View project summary
tfgrid-compose summary my-project
```

### SSH Access

```bash
# SSH into VM
tfgrid-compose ssh

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep ai-agent

# View project files
ls -la /home/developer/code/

# Check system logs  
journalctl -u tfgrid-ai-agent -f
```

### Status Overview

```bash
# All projects status
tfgrid-compose projects

# Deployment status
tfgrid-compose status

# Service status on VM
tfgrid-compose ssh
systemctl status tfgrid-ai-agent
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
tfgrid-compose logs my-project

# Check service status
tfgrid-compose ssh
systemctl status tfgrid-ai-agent
journalctl -u tfgrid-ai-agent -n 50

# Restart service if needed
systemctl restart tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### SSH Connection Issues

```bash
# Check WireGuard
sudo wg show

# Test connectivity (get IP from status)
tfgrid-compose status
ping -c 3 10.1.3.2  # Use your actual IP

# Reconnect if needed
tfgrid-compose ssh
```

### Out of Disk Space

```bash
# SSH in and check
tfgrid-compose ssh
df -h

# Clean up old projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project-name

# Or increase disk size (requires redeployment)
# Edit app's tfgrid-compose.yaml ‚Üí resources.disk
tfgrid-compose down
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check resource usage
tfgrid-compose ssh
htop

# Consider upgrading resources
# Edit app's tfgrid-compose.yaml ‚Üí resources (cpu/memory)
tfgrid-compose down
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Project Organization

```bash
# Use descriptive names
ai-agent create webapp-dashboard  # Good
ai-agent create test1             # Bad

# One project per goal
ai-agent create frontend-app
ai-agent create backend-api
# Not: ai-agent create fullstack-everything
```

### 2. Prompts

**Good prompts:**

- "Create a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL for a todo app"
- "Refactor this code to use async/await instead of callbacks"
- "Add comprehensive error handling and logging"

**Bad prompts:**

- "Make it better" (too vague)
- "Build everything" (too broad)
- "Fix bugs" (which bugs?)

### 3. Monitoring

```bash
# Always monitor long-running tasks
tfgrid-compose run big-project &
tfgrid-compose monitor big-project
```

### 4. Git Workflow

```bash
# Agent auto-commits to local git
# Review before pushing
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/my-project
git log
git diff
git push origin main
```

### 5. Resource Management

```bash
# Stop projects when not needed
tfgrid-compose stopall

# Remove completed projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project

# Destroy VM when not in use
tfgrid-compose down
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Projects

```bash
# Create and run multiple projects
tfgrid-compose create frontend
tfgrid-compose create backend
tfgrid-compose create docs

tfgrid-compose run frontend &
tfgrid-compose run backend &
tfgrid-compose run docs &

# Monitor all
tfgrid-compose projects
```

### Custom Automation Scripts

```bash
# Create local automation script
cat > ~/ai-agent-batch.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
for project in "$@"; do
  tfgrid-compose create "$project"
  tfgrid-compose run "$project" &
done
tfgrid-compose projects
EOF

chmod +x ~/ai-agent-batch.sh

# Use it
~/ai-agent-batch.sh frontend backend docs
```

### Scheduled Runs

```bash
# SSH into VM and setup cron
tfgrid-compose ssh
crontab -e

# Add scheduled runs (runs on VM)
0 2 * * * cd /opt/ai-agent && ./scripts/run-project.sh nightly-refactor
0 9 * * * cd /opt/ai-agent && ./scripts/run-project.sh morning-docs
```

A: Depends on ThreeFold Grid pricing. Typically $10-30/month for a 4CPU/8GB VM.

**Q: Can I access from multiple machines?**  
A: Yes, deploy once and use `tfgrid-compose exec` from any machine with access.

**Q: What if my local machine disconnects?**  
A: Agent keeps running on the VM. Reconnect anytime with `tfgrid-compose ssh`.

**Q: Can I use my own AI API keys?**  
A: Yes, set `QWEN_API_KEY` before deployment or SSH in and configure.

**Q: How do I backup projects?**  
A: SSH in and copy `/home/developer/code/` or use git push to remote.

**Q: Can I upgrade the agent version?**  
A: Yes, `tfgrid-compose down` then deploy updated app from registry.

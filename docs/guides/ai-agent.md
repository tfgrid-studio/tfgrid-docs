# AI Agent Guide

Complete guide for deploying and using the AI coding agent on ThreeFold Grid.

---

## Overview

The **TFGrid AI Agent** is an autonomous AI coding assistant that runs on ThreeFold Grid. It can:

- ü§ñ Write and edit code autonomously
- üîÑ Run iterative improvement loops
- üß™ Test and debug automatically
- üìù Generate documentation
- üîß Refactor and optimize code
- ‚è∞ Work within time constraints

**Deployment time:** 2-3 minutes  
**Cost:** Pay-as-you-go on ThreeFold Grid  
**Access:** Native commands via `tfgrid-compose`

**Version:** 0.3.0 (Pre-1.0)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the AI Agent

```bash
# Deploy to ThreeFold Grid
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

**What happens:**

1. ‚úÖ Creates Ubuntu 24.04 VM (4 CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB disk)
2. ‚úÖ Configures WireGuard networking  
3. ‚úÖ Installs Node.js 20.x, Qwen CLI
4. ‚úÖ Prompts for git credentials (one time)
5. ‚úÖ Sets up workspace at `/home/developer/code`
6. ‚úÖ Runs health checks

**Duration:** ~2-3 minutes

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ üéâ Deployment complete!
‚Ñπ App: tfgrid-ai-agent v0.3.0
‚Ñπ Pattern: single-vm v1.0.0
‚Ñπ Next steps:
  ‚Ä¢ Check status: tfgrid-compose status tfgrid-ai-agent
  ‚Ä¢ View logs: tfgrid-compose logs tfgrid-ai-agent
  ‚Ä¢ Connect: tfgrid-compose ssh tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### 2. Configure Git Identity

Configure your git identity for commit attribution:

```bash
tfgrid-compose login
```

The login flow collects:

- ThreeFold mnemonic
- GitHub token (optional)
- Gitea credentials (optional)
- Git name (for commit attribution)
- Git email (for commit attribution)

Git identity is automatically deployed to all VMs and used for all project commits.

### 3. Create Your First Project

```bash
tfgrid-compose create my-music-website
```

Interactive prompts:

1. **Project name** (if not specified)
2. **Duration** (30m, 1h, 2h, indefinite)
3. **Git credentials** (if not configured)
4. **Prompt type** (Custom or Generic template)
5. **Your coding prompt**
6. **Start now?** (y/N)

**Example session:**
```
üöÄ AI-Agent Project Creator

tfgrid-compose tfgrid-ai-agent create my-project
tfgrid-compose tfgrid-ai-agent run my-project
```

**Context is automatic with single app!**

---

## Project Selection & Context

The AI agent supports project-level context for streamlined command usage.

### Two-Level Context System

```
App Context (tfgrid-ai-agent)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Context (my-project)
```

### Select Active Project

```bash
# Interactive selection (shows all projects with status)
tfgrid-compose select-project

# Direct selection
tfgrid-compose select-project my-project
```

### Context-Aware Commands

Once a project is selected, commands use it automatically:

```bash
# Select project once
tfgrid-compose select-project frontend-app

# All subsequent commands use selected project
tfgrid-compose run        # Runs frontend-app
tfgrid-compose logs       # Logs for frontend-app
tfgrid-compose monitor    # Monitors frontend-app
tfgrid-compose stop       # Stops frontend-app
```

### Override Context

Provide project name to override selection:

```bash
# Context is set to frontend-app
tfgrid-compose select-project frontend-app

# But you can still run commands on other projects
tfgrid-compose run backend-api     # Runs backend-api
tfgrid-compose logs mobile-app     # Logs for mobile-app
```

### Clear Selection

```bash
# Clear project context
tfgrid-compose unselect-project

# Commands now require project name
tfgrid-compose run          # Error: No project specified
tfgrid-compose run my-app   # Works
```

---

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Simple Web App

```bash
# 1. Deploy
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent

# 2. Configure git (first time only)
tfgrid-compose login

# 3. Create project (interactive)
tfgrid-compose create simple-blog
# Prompts for:
# - Duration: 1h
# - Prompt: "Create a simple blog with React and Node.js"
# - Start now: y

# 4. Monitor progress
tfgrid-compose monitor simple-blog

# 5. Check all projects
tfgrid-compose projects

# 6. View results
tfgrid-compose summary simple-blog
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/simple-blog
ls -la
cat README.md

# 7. Stop project
tfgrid-compose stop simple-blog

# 8. Cleanup (if done)
tfgrid-compose down
```

### Workflow 2: Code Refactoring

```bash
# 1. Create refactoring project
tfgrid-compose create refactor-legacy
# Prompt: "Refactor this legacy code to TypeScript with best practices"

# 2. Upload existing code
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/refactor-legacy
# Copy your files here
git add .
git commit -m "Initial code to refactor"
exit

# 3. Run agent
tfgrid-compose run refactor-legacy

# 4. Watch it work
tfgrid-compose monitor refactor-legacy

# 5. Check progress
tfgrid-compose summary refactor-legacy

# 6. Review and iterate
tfgrid-compose logs refactor-legacy
tfgrid-compose edit refactor-legacy  # Adjust if needed
tfgrid-compose restart refactor-legacy
```

### Workflow 3: Multiple Projects (Concurrent Execution)

```bash
# Create several projects
tfgrid-compose create frontend-app
tfgrid-compose create backend-api
tfgrid-compose create mobile-app

# Run them all - executes concurrently via systemd
tfgrid-compose run frontend-app
tfgrid-compose run backend-api
tfgrid-compose run mobile-app

# All three projects run simultaneously
# Each has isolated resources: 2GB memory, 150% CPU quota
# Auto-restart on failure with 10s delay

# Check status of all running projects
tfgrid-compose projects

# Monitor specific one
tfgrid-compose monitor frontend-app

# Stop all when done
tfgrid-compose stopall
```

**New Feature:** Projects execute in parallel using systemd template services (`tfgrid-ai-project@{name}.service`). Each project runs in an isolated service instance with dedicated resource limits (2GB memory, 150% CPU quota) and automatic failure recovery. You can now run unlimited concurrent AI agents simultaneously.

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Prompts

**Good:**
```
"Create a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL for a todo app with authentication"
"Refactor this code to use async/await and add error handling"
"Generate API documentation with examples for all endpoints"
```

**Bad:**
```
"Make it better" (too vague)
"Build everything" (too broad)
"Fix bugs" (which bugs?)
```

### 2. Time Constraints

```bash
# Short tasks
tfgrid-compose create quick-fix
# Duration: 30m

# Medium projects
tfgrid-compose create web-dashboard  
# Duration: 2h

# Long-running projects
tfgrid-compose create full-refactor
# Duration: indefinite
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

```bash
# Always monitor long-running tasks
tfgrid-compose run big-project &
tfgrid-compose monitor big-project

# Check all projects regularly
tfgrid-compose projects
```

### 4. Resource Management

```bash
# Stop when not needed
tfgrid-compose stopall

# Remove completed projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project

# Destroy VM when done
tfgrid-compose down
```

##Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these on your local machine before deployment:

```bash
# Required
export TF_VAR_mnemonic=$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)

# Optional
export QWEN_API_KEY='your-api-key'        # Qwen API key
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your-token'           # GitHub personal token
export GITEA_URL='https://gitea.example'   # Gitea URL
export GITEA_TOKEN='your-token'            # Gitea personal token
```

### Custom Resources

Edit `tfgrid-ai-agent/tfgrid-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  cpu:
    minimum: 2
    recommended: 4     # Change this
  memory:
    minimum: 4096
    recommended: 8192  # Change this
  disk:
    minimum: 50
    recommended: 100   # Change this
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
tfgrid-compose down && tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

## Monitoring & Logs

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Watch agent progress
tfgrid-compose monitor my-project

# View live logs
tfgrid-compose logs my-project

# View project summary
tfgrid-compose summary my-project
```

### SSH Access

```bash
# SSH into VM
tfgrid-compose ssh

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep ai-agent

# View project files
ls -la /home/developer/code/

# Check system logs (per-project systemd services)
journalctl -u tfgrid-ai-project@my-project.service -f
```

### Status Overview

```bash
# All projects status
tfgrid-compose projects

# Deployment status
tfgrid-compose status

# Per-project service status on VM
tfgrid-compose ssh
systemctl status tfgrid-ai-project@my-project.service
systemctl list-units 'tfgrid-ai-project@*'  # List all project services
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
tfgrid-compose logs my-project

# Check service status (per-project)
tfgrid-compose ssh
systemctl status tfgrid-ai-project@my-project.service
journalctl -u tfgrid-ai-project@my-project.service -n 50

# Restart service if needed
systemctl restart tfgrid-ai-project@my-project.service
```

### SSH Connection Issues

```bash
# Check WireGuard
sudo wg show

# Test connectivity (get IP from status)
tfgrid-compose status
ping -c 3 10.1.3.2  # Use your actual IP

# Reconnect if needed
tfgrid-compose ssh
```

### Out of Disk Space

```bash
# SSH in and check
tfgrid-compose ssh
df -h

# Clean up old projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project-name

# Or increase disk size (requires redeployment)
# Edit app's tfgrid-compose.yaml ‚Üí resources.disk
tfgrid-compose down
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check resource usage
tfgrid-compose ssh
htop

# Consider upgrading resources
# Edit app's tfgrid-compose.yaml ‚Üí resources (cpu/memory)
tfgrid-compose down
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Project Organization

```bash
# Use descriptive names
ai-agent create webapp-dashboard  # Good
ai-agent create test1             # Bad

# One project per goal
ai-agent create frontend-app
ai-agent create backend-api
# Not: ai-agent create fullstack-everything
```

### 2. Prompts

**Good prompts:**

- "Create a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL for a todo app"
- "Refactor this code to use async/await instead of callbacks"
- "Add comprehensive error handling and logging"

**Bad prompts:**

- "Make it better" (too vague)
- "Build everything" (too broad)
- "Fix bugs" (which bugs?)

### 3. Monitoring

```bash
# Always monitor long-running tasks
tfgrid-compose run big-project &
tfgrid-compose monitor big-project
```

### 4. Git Workflow

```bash
# Agent auto-commits to local git
# Review before pushing
tfgrid-compose ssh
cd /home/developer/code/my-project
git log
git diff
git push origin main
```

### 5. Resource Management

```bash
# Stop projects when not needed
tfgrid-compose stopall

# Remove completed projects
tfgrid-compose remove old-project

# Destroy VM when not in use
tfgrid-compose down
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Projects

```bash
# Create and run multiple projects
tfgrid-compose create frontend
tfgrid-compose create backend
tfgrid-compose create docs

tfgrid-compose run frontend &
tfgrid-compose run backend &
tfgrid-compose run docs &

# Monitor all
tfgrid-compose projects
```

### Custom Automation Scripts

```bash
# Create local automation script
cat > ~/ai-agent-batch.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
for project in "$@"; do
  tfgrid-compose create "$project"
  tfgrid-compose run "$project" &
done
tfgrid-compose projects
EOF

chmod +x ~/ai-agent-batch.sh

# Use it
~/ai-agent-batch.sh frontend backend docs
```

### Scheduled Runs

```bash
# SSH into VM and setup cron
tfgrid-compose ssh
crontab -e

# Add scheduled runs (runs on VM)
0 2 * * * cd /opt/ai-agent && ./scripts/run-project.sh nightly-refactor
0 9 * * * cd /opt/ai-agent && ./scripts/run-project.sh morning-docs
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run multiple agents simultaneously?**
A: Yes! Projects run concurrently using systemd template services. Each project has dedicated resources (2GB memory, 150% CPU quota) and automatic failure recovery. You can run unlimited concurrent AI agents, each working on different projects simultaneously. Use `tfgrid-compose projects` to view all running projects.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: Depends on ThreeFold Grid pricing. Typically $10-30/month for a 4CPU/8GB VM.

**Q: Can I access from multiple machines?**  
A: Yes, deploy once and use `tfgrid-compose exec` from any machine with access.

**Q: What if my local machine disconnects?**  
A: Agent keeps running on the VM. Reconnect anytime with `tfgrid-compose ssh`.

**Q: Can I use my own AI API keys?**  
A: Yes, set `QWEN_API_KEY` before deployment or SSH in and configure.

**Q: How do I backup projects?**  
A: SSH in and copy `/home/developer/code/` or use git push to remote.

**Q: Can I upgrade the agent version?**  
A: Yes, `tfgrid-compose down` then deploy updated app from registry.

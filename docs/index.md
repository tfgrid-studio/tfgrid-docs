## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install tfgrid-compose

```bash
# One-line installer
curl -sSL install.tfgrid.studio/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
tfgrid-compose --version
```

Need a ThreeFold wallet with TFT? See the [complete setup guide](getting-started/threefold-setup.md).

Already have a wallet? Configure it:
```bash
tfgrid-compose login
# Enter your seed phrase when prompted
```

### 3. Deploy an App

```bash
# Deploy official app (v0.10.0+)
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent

# Or use local path (current)

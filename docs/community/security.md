## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**We take security seriously.** If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### üîí How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead, use one of these secure channels:**

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisory (Preferred)
1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private advisory form
4. Submit

#### 2. Email
Send details to: **[security@tfgrid.studio](mailto:security@tfgrid.studio)**

**Encrypt with PGP:** (optional but recommended)
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key will be published separately]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### üìã What to Include

**Please provide:**
- **Description:** Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact:** What an attacker could do
- **Affected versions:** Which versions are vulnerable
- **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed reproduction steps
- **Proof of concept:** Code/commands demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
- **Suggested fix:** If you have ideas (optional)
- **Your contact info:** For follow-up questions

**Example report:**
```
Title: Mnemonic exposure in debug logs

Description:
When running with debug mode, the ThreeFold mnemonic is logged
in plain text to .tfgrid-compose/terraform-apply.log

Impact:
An attacker with access to log files could steal wallet credentials
and drain funds from the ThreeFold account.

Affected Versions:
tfgrid-compose v0.9.0 and earlier

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable debug mode
2. Run: tfgrid-compose --debug up <app>
3. Check: .tfgrid-compose/terraform-apply.log
4. Mnemonic visible in output

Suggested Fix:
Redact TF_VAR_mnemonic from all log output
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Mnemonic Security

**Store securely:**
```bash
# Create secure config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/threefold
chmod 700 ~/.config/threefold

# Store mnemonic with restricted permissions
echo "your twelve word mnemonic here" > ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
chmod 600 ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic

# Verify permissions
ls -la ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
# Should show: -rw------- (600)
```

**Never:**
- ‚ùå Commit mnemonics to version control
- ‚ùå Share mnemonics in chat/email
- ‚ùå Store in publicly accessible locations
- ‚ùå Use same mnemonic across environments

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Rotate mnemonics regularly
- ‚úÖ Use separate mnemonics for dev/prod
- ‚úÖ Back up securely (encrypted offline storage)

#### SSH Key Management

**Use strong keys:**
```bash
# Generate Ed25519 key (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/tfgrid_ed25519

# Or RSA 4096-bit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/tfgrid_rsa
```

**Protect private keys:**
```bash
# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/tfgrid_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/tfgrid_ed25519.pub

# Use passphrase (recommended)
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/tfgrid_ed25519
```

#### WireGuard Security

**Key management:**
- Generated keys stored in Terraform state
- Private keys in `/etc/wireguard/` (600 permissions)
- Don't share WireGuard configurations

**Network isolation:**
- WireGuard creates private networks
- No default internet routing
- Explicitly configure external access if needed

#### Deployment Security

**State files contain sensitive data:**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".tfgrid-compose/" >> .gitignore
echo ".terraform/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.tfstate*" >> .gitignore

# Never commit:
# - .tfgrid-compose/
# - Terraform state files
# - WireGuard configs
# - Private keys
```

**Clean up after testing:**
```bash
# Remove sensitive logs
rm -rf .tfgrid-compose/

# Remove WireGuard configs
sudo rm -f /etc/wireguard/wg*.conf
```

### For Contributors

#### Code Security

**Never commit:**
- API keys or tokens
- Passwords or secrets
- Private keys
- Mnemonics or seed phrases
- Personal data

**Use secure coding practices:**
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize log output
- Use parameterized commands (avoid injection)
- Check file permissions
- Handle errors securely

**Example - Redacting sensitive data:**
```bash
# ‚ùå Bad: Logs mnemonic
echo "Using mnemonic: $TF_VAR_mnemonic"

# ‚úÖ Good: Redacts mnemonic
if [ -n "$TF_VAR_mnemonic" ]; then
    echo "Mnemonic loaded successfully"
else
    echo "Mnemonic not found"
fi
```

#### Dependency Security

**Keep dependencies updated:**
```bash
# Check for updates
ansible --version
terraform --version
tofu --version

# Update to latest
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

**Review third-party code:**
- Audit pattern contributions
- Review Terraform modules
- Check Ansible roles
- Verify scripts before execution

### For Maintainers

#### Release Security

**Before release:**
- Review all PRs for security issues
- Run security scanners
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Verify dependency versions
- Test in isolated environment

**Release checklist:**
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Security advisory reviewed
- [ ] CHANGELOG includes security fixes
- [ ] Version bumped appropriately

#### Incident Response

**If vulnerability found:**
1. Assess severity immediately
2. Notify security team
3. Develop fix in private
4. Test thoroughly
5. Coordinate disclosure
6. Release patch
7. Notify users

## Common Security Issues

### Mnemonic Exposure

**Risk:** High - Can lead to fund theft

**Vectors:**
- Logs containing mnemonics
- Committed to version control
- Insecure file permissions
- Exposed in error messages

**Prevention:**
- Redact from all logs
- Check file permissions
- Use `.gitignore`
- Sanitize error output

### State File Exposure

**Risk:** Medium - Contains deployment details

**Vectors:**
- Committed to version control
- Publicly accessible storage
- Insufficient file permissions

**Prevention:**
- Add to `.gitignore`
- Use secure state backends
- Restrict file permissions
- Clean up after use

### SSH Key Compromise

**Risk:** High - Unauthorized VM access

**Vectors:**
- Weak key strength
- No passphrase
- Insecure storage
- Shared keys

**Prevention:**
- Use Ed25519 or RSA 4096
- Use passphrases
- Restrict permissions (600)
- Unique keys per deployment

### WireGuard Config Exposure

**Risk:** Medium - Network access

**Vectors:**
- World-readable files
- Committed to repos
- Shared configurations

**Prevention:**
- 600 permissions on configs
- Don't commit configs
- Rotate keys regularly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install tfgrid-compose

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/tfgrid-studio/tfgrid-compose
cd tfgrid-compose
make install

# Verify installation
tfgrid-compose --version
```

### 2. Configure ThreeFold

```bash
# Store your mnemonic
mkdir -p ~/.config/threefold
echo "your mnemonic words" > ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
chmod 600 ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
```

### 3. Create Context File (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# In your project directory
echo "app: ../tfgrid-ai-agent" > .tfgrid-compose.yaml
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# With context file
tfgrid-compose up

# Or specify app path
tfgrid-compose up ../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

**That's it!** Your application is now running on ThreeFold Grid. 🎉

## 💡 Why TFGrid Compose?

### ✅ No Vendor Lock-in
Uses industry standards: **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Kubernetes**. Your apps aren't locked to ThreeFold Grid.

### ✅ Simple & Powerful
**Heroku-like UX** with production-ready patterns. One command to deploy, full control when needed.

### ✅ Decentralized Infrastructure
Runs on **ThreeFold Grid**: decentralized compute, no single point of failure, cost-effective.

### ✅ Open Source
**Apache 2.0 license**. Free to use, modify, and distribute. Community-driven development.

### ✅ Battle-Tested
Built from **proven, working implementations**:
- Gateway pattern: Based on [mik-tf/tfgrid-gateway](https://github.com/mik-tf/tfgrid-gateway)
- K3s pattern: Based on [ucli-tools/tfgrid-k3s](https://github.com/ucli-tools/tfgrid-k3s)
- AI agent: Based on [mik-tf/tfgrid-ai-agent](https://github.com/mik-tf/tfgrid-ai-agent)
